The survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has substantially improved with current treatments.
Nevertheless, the appearance of drug-resistant cancer cells leads to patient relapse. It is therefore necessary to find
new antitumor therapies that can completely eradicate transformed cells. Chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells are
characterized by the overexpression of members of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein family, such as
Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1. We have recently shown that peptides derived from the BH3 domain of the pro-apoptotic Bax
protein may antagonize the anti-apoptotic activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins, restore apoptosis, and induce
chemosensitization of tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of releasing this peptide into the
tumor microenvironment using live attenuated Salmonella enterica, which has proven to be an ally in cancer therapy due
to its high affinity for tumor tissue, its ability to activate the innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses, and
its potential use as a delivery system of heterologous molecules. Thus, we expressed and released the cell-permeable Bax
BH3 peptide from the surface of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL3261 through the MisL autotransporter system.
We demonstrated that this recombinant bacterium significantly decreased the viability and increased the apoptosis of
Ramos cells, a human B NHL cell line. Indeed, the intravenous administration of this recombinant Salmonella enterica
elicited antitumor activity and extended survival in a xenograft NHL murine model. This antitumor activity was mediated
by apoptosis and an inflammatory response. Our approach may represent an eventual alternative to treat relapsing or
refractory NHL.
