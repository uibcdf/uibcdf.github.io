Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway and is highly relevant in
the metabolism of Giardia lamblia. Previous reports suggested that the G6PD gene is fused with the
6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) gene (6pgl). Therefore, in this work, we decided to characterize the fused G6PD-6PGL
protein in Giardia lamblia. First, the gene of g6pd fused with the 6pgl gene (6gpd::6pgl) was isolated from trophozoites
of Giardia lamblia and the corresponding G6PD::6PGL protein was overexpressed and purified in Escherichia coli. Then, we
characterized the native oligomeric state of the G6PD::6PGL protein in solution and we found a catalytic dimer with an
optimum pH of 8.75. Furthermore, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for the G6PD domain and measured the
thermal stability of the protein in both the presence and absence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and observed that
the G6PD::6PGL protein showed alterations in the stability, secondary structure, and tertiary structure in the presence
of Gdn-HCl. Finally, computer modeling studies revealed unique structural and functional features, which clearly
established the differences between G6PD::6PGL protein from G. lamblia and the human G6PD enzyme, proving that the model
can be used for the design of new drugs with antigiardiasic activity. These results broaden the perspective for future
studies of the function of the protein and its effect on the metabolism of this parasite as a potential pharmacological
target.
