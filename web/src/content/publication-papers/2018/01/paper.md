The deficiency of glucose‑6‑phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism
worldwide. This congenital disorder generally results from mutations that are spread throughout the entire gene of G6PD.
Three single-point mutations for G6PD have been reported in the Mexican population and named Veracruz (Arg365His), G6PD
Seattle (Asp282His), and G6PD Mexico DF (Thr65Ala), whose biochemical characterization have not yet been studied. For
this reason, in this work we analyzed the putative role of the three mutations to uncover the functional consequences on
G6PD activity. To this end, was developed a method to clone, overexpress, and purify recombinant human G6PD. The results
obtained from all variants showed a loss of catalysis by 80 to 97% and had a decrease in affinity for both physiological
substrates with respect to the wild type (WT) G6PD. Our results also showed that the three mutations affected
three-dimensional structure and protein stability, suggesting an unstable structure with low conformational stability
that affected its G6PD functionality. Finally, based on the biochemical characterization of the unclassified G6PD Mexico
DF, we suggest that this variant could be grouped as a Class I variant, because biochemical data are similar with other
Class I G6PDs.
