Opitz GBBB syndrome (GBBB) is an X-linked disease characterized by midline defects, including congenital heart defects.
We present our diagnostic approach to the identification of GBBB in a consanguineous family in which two males siblings
were concordant for a total anomalous connection of pulmonary veins and minor facial dysmorphias.
