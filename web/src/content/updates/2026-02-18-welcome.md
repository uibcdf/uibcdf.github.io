Welcome to the new UIBCDF website.

We are very happy to open this new space and share it with our community.
Our goal with this website is simple: make it easier to discover who we are, what we work on, and how our research evolves over time.

Here you can explore our research lines, meet the people behind the projects, and browse selected publications and open software developed in the unit.
You will also find a unified updates stream where we will post seminars, scientific news, opportunities, releases, and announcements.

We hope this platform helps students, collaborators, and colleagues connect with our work more easily.
Thank you for visiting, and please check back regularly as we continue growing this site and sharing new content.
