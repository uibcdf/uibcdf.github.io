Advancing the discovery of functional peptides requires integrative frameworks capable of connecting biophysical
knowledge with data-driven modeling. This research focuses on the development of computational methodologies that
combine molecular simulation with machine learning and AI techniques to identify patterns linking sequence, structure,
and biological activity across diverse peptide families. By leveraging predictive models that generalize to novel
sequences and biological contexts, the approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional peptide design
strategies and expand the accessible functional sequence space.

The work is supported by a computational platform that integrates classification and prediction algorithms with
structural analysis and simulation-based evaluation. The framework incorporates peptide-oriented design strategies such
as sequence embeddings derived from protein language models, pharmacophore-inspired approaches, generative models
including diffusion-based architectures, and computational binder design targeting specific biomolecular systems.
Molecular dynamics simulations complement these methods by enabling the assessment of conformational stability, target
interactions, and physicochemical properties, forming an iterative discovery cycle that facilitates candidate
prioritization and optimization toward more selective and effective peptide therapeutics.
