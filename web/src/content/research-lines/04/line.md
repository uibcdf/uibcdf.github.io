Accelerated aging is employed as a controlled stress model to uncover native or cryptic peptide segments exhibiting
intrinsic affinity for biological membranes. Within this framework, the present research line is focused on the rational
discovery of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) derived from the proteome associated with accelerated aging of seeds from
the Zapalote Chico creole maize (Zea mays L.), through the integration of complementary biochemical and computational
approaches.

This research strategy aims to identify, structurally characterize, and rationally optimize -both in vitro and in
silico- functionalized CPPs displaying differentiated activity profiles, including vectorial and dual-function
modalities (membrane translocation coupled to intrinsic bioactivity). The overarching objective is to generate peptide
entities grounded in robust structural and physicochemical principles, thereby establishing a platform of
mechanistically informed candidates suitable for development as delivery vectors or therapeutic scaffolds in
biotechnological and oncological contexts.
