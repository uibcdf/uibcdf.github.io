This research line aims to systematically map and compare the structural, dynamical, and energetic determinants of
critical regulatory nodes within tumor glycolysis, adopting a multi-enzymatic allosteric framework. Through multiscale
modeling, advanced molecular simulations, and free-energy landscape analysis, we characterize how conformational
ensembles, long-range coupling networks, and energetic redistribution shape metabolic control in cancer cells. By
integrating comparative structural analysis across glycolytic isoenzymes and associated pathways, this approach
identifies emergent regulatory vulnerabilities and mechanistically informed intervention points, providing a foundation
for the rational design of allosteric modulators and network-level metabolic regulators with oncological relevance.
