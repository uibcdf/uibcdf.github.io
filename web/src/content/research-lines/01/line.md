Advances in computational biology increasingly depend on integrated software infrastructures capable of connecting
heterogeneous data, theoretical models, and analytical methods. This research line focuses on the development of
open-source computational tools that enable the comprehensive study, characterization, and interpretation of molecular
systems, supporting drug discovery workflows through interoperable and reproducible methodologies.

The program encompasses the design and continuous development of a modular ecosystem of tools for working with molecular
structures, simulations, and derived data. These include frameworks for molecular system representation and
visualization, structural and topological analysis of pockets and interfaces, pharmacophore modeling, elastic network
approaches for allosteric mechanisms, preparation of complex systems such as membranes, and emerging methods for binding
free-energy estimation. In addition, dedicated tools integrate and organize molecular knowledge from distributed online
resources, facilitating data-driven research.
