Together with some students from the UNAM postgraduate course "From the
molecular target's structure to the rational drug design - 2018", we have
created a `new slack workspace <https://d3mexico.slack.com/messages>`_ to share
experiences on the field of the Drug Design and Discovery in México. We will
work to make this team an important meeting point where mexican researchers can
find useful information and interactions fostering community consolidation.
