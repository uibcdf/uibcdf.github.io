# Information architecture (IA) — UIBCDF Lab Website

This file freezes the sitemap and navigation for version `1.0.0`.

## Top navigation

- Home
- Research
- Team
- Publications
- >Code (route `/software`)
- Updates
- Contact

## Notes
- Menu behavior: keep `Home` as first item; current page is visually attenuated and marked with `aria-current="page"`.
- Updates are **one section** with **tags** to avoid fragmentation.
- Home highlights latest updates and links to the full Updates page.
- Publications are grouped by year (descending).
- Code is grouped in three sections: MolSysSuite ecosystem, Software engineering utilities, GitHub Actions.

## Next-version IA note
- Positioning/mission content must be explicit in the next version.
- Home will include a new first scroll stop titled `What we do`, with the approved positioning text.
- The `What we do` block will include a clear link to a dedicated `Mission` section.
- Top navigation for next version will include `Mission` as a menu item.
- `Mission` page will contain an extended explanation of what the lab does and its purpose.
