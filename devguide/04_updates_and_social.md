# Updates & social diffusion policy — UIBCDF Lab Website

    This site is Markdown-first and static. Social platforms are treated as **distribution channels**.

    ## Canonical source of truth
    - Posts on this site (under `web/src/content/`) are canonical.
    - Social networks link back to the canonical post/page.

    ## Embeds
    - Embeds are optional and must never be required for core content.
    - Place embeds below the fold and provide explicit “Follow us” links.

    ## OpenGraph & sharing
    - Every post should have a strong title + 1–2 line summary (used for previews).
    - Provide a default OpenGraph image and allow post-specific OG images later.

    ## Practical rule
    Prefer a stable, curated “Latest updates” list over a fragile live timeline.

    ## Project-specific notes
    - Updates page shows a unified feed with tag filtering.
    - Updates page includes client-side text search and date range filters (`from` / `to`).
    - The "Search and filter" panel is sticky while browsing posts.
    - A vertical progress bar on the filter panel acts as scroll indicator and draggable slider.
    - Optionally, link to GitHub releases and social accounts, but avoid auto-fetching.
