# MVP scope — UIBCDF Lab Website

    This file defines what “version 1” includes, what it explicitly excludes, and what is planned next.

    ## MVP (v1)
    - Home page with concise unit description and highlights.
- Pages: Research, People, Publications, Software, Updates, Contact.
- Updates: unified stream with tags (seminars/news/publications/software/events/opportunities).
- Simple, readable design (“less is more”).
- Deployed to GitHub Pages at `www.uibcdf.org`.

    ## Non-goals (v1)
    - No CMS in v1 (GitHub editing only).
- No automated social feeds (no fragile API dependencies).
- No full internal member portal, logins, or backend.
- No heavy interactive dashboards.

    ## Phase 2 ideas
    - Decap CMS for easier editing (if/when needed).
- Calendar integration for seminars (embed or .ics rendering).
- Optional lightweight “latest GitHub releases” widget for software highlights.
- Multilingual support if desired (ES/EN), keeping pages minimal.
