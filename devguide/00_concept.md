# Concept — UIBCDF Lab Website

## Purpose
Provide an institutional, human, and up-to-date public face for the UIBCDF research unit: mission, people, research lines, publications, software, and ongoing activity (seminars/news).

## Primary audience
Researchers, students, collaborators, institutional stakeholders, and potential partners looking for who we are, what we do, and how to contact us.

## Success criteria (how we know it works)
Visitors can quickly understand the unit’s focus and credibility, find people/publications/software, and see that the unit is active (updates and seminars).

## Constraints
- Static site (no backend required for MVP).
- Content editable via GitHub (Decap CMS considered later).
- “Less is more”: clarity and hierarchy over ornament.
