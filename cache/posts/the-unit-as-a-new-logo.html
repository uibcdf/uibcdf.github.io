<p>The Unit has a new logo to be included in slides, posters, and documents as the identifying graphic image. The logo has been designed by us combining common elements of the Children's Hospital of Mexico, such as the distinctive colors -blue, orange and yellow- of the Hemato-Oncology and Research tower where the UIBCF is located; and a conceptual reference to the topic of research of the Unit, the rational design of organic molecules -a ligand molecule depicted as a sequence of orange and yellow dots in the logotype- with the capability of binding to a specific  pharmacological target -the blue dots region in the logotype-.</p>
