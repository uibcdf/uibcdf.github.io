their unique ability to transport a wide range of substances—such as small molecules, plasmid DNA, small interfering
RNA, proteins, viruses, and nanoparticles—across cellular membranes while preserving the integrity of the cargo. CPPs
exhibit passive and non-selective behavior, often requiring functionalization or chemical modification to enhance their
specificity and efficacy. The precise mechanisms governing the cellular uptake of CPPs remain ambiguous; however,
electrostatic interactions between positively charged amino acids and negatively charged glycosaminoglycans on the
membrane, particularly heparan sulfate proteoglycans, are considered the initial crucial step for CPP uptake. Clinical
trials have highlighted the potential of CPPs in diagnosing and treating various diseases, including cancer, central
nervous system disorders, eye disorders, and diabetes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of CPP
classifications, potential applications, transduction mechanisms, and the most relevant algorithms to improve the
accuracy and reliability of predictions in CPP development.</p>

diverse key regulatory functions in the cell membrane. Its malfunction has been linked to a growing number of human
diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, and some neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and aging diseases.
Furthermore, inhibition of this enzyme jeopardizes the survival of several bacterial pathogens of public health concern.
Therefore, FOF1-ATP synthase has emerged as a novel drug target both to treat human diseases and to combat antibiotic
resistance. In this work, we carried out a computational characterization of the binding sites of the fungal antibiotic
aurovertin in the bovine F1 subcomplex, which shares a large identity with the human enzyme. Molecular dynamics
simulations showed that although the binding sites can be described as preformed, the inhibitor hinders inter-subunit
communications and exerts long-range effects on the dynamics of the catalytic site residues. End-point binding free
energy calculations revealed hot spot residues for aurovertin recognition. These residues were also relevant to
stabilize solvent sites determined from mixed-solvent molecular dynamics, which mimic the interaction between aurovertin
and the enzyme, and could be used as pharmacophore constraints in virtual screening campaigns. To explore the
possibility of finding species-specific inhibitors targeting the aurovertin binding site, we performed free energy
calculations for two bacterial enzymes with experimentally solved 3D structures. Finally, an analysis of bacterial
sequences was carried out to determine conservation of the aurovertin binding site. Taken together, our results
constitute a first step in paving the way for structure-based development of new allosteric drugs targeting FOF1-ATP
synthase sites of exogenous inhibitors.</p>

DNMT1 characterized in enzymatic inhibition assays that did not show activity with DNMT3B. It was concluded that the
dietary component theaflavin is an inhibitor of DNMT1. Two additional novel inhibitors of DNMT1 are the approved drugs
glyburide and panobinostat. The DNMT1 enzymatic inhibitory activity of panobinostat, a known pan inhibitor of histone
deacetylases, agrees with experimental reports of its ability to reduce DNMT1 activity in liver cancer cell lines.
Molecular docking of the active compounds with DNMT1, and re-scoring with the recently developed extended connectivity
interaction features approach, led to an excellent agreement between the experimental IC50 values and docking scores.</p>

worldwide, and although survival rates have improved with conventional treatments, the development of drug-resistant
cancer cells may lead to patient relapse and limited possibilities of a cure. Drug-resistant cancer cells in these
hematologic neoplasms are induced by overexpression of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein families,
such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1. We have previously shown that peptides from the BH3 domain of the proapoptotic Bax
protein that also belongs to the Bcl-2 family may antagonize the antiapoptotic activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins,
restore apoptosis, and induce chemosensitization of tumor cells. Furthermore, cell-permeable Bax BH3 peptides also
elicit antitumor activity and extend survival in a murine xenograft model of human B non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However,
the activity of the BH3 peptides of the proapoptotic Bak protein of the Bcl-2 family against these hematologic malignant
cells requires further characterization. In this study, we report the ability of the cell-permeable Bak BH3 peptide to
restore apoptosis and induce chemosensitization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines,
and this event is enhanced with the coadministration of cell-permeable Bax BH3 peptide and represents an attractive
approach to improve the patient outcomes with relapsed or refractory hematological malignant cells.</p>

Three single-point mutations for G6PD have been reported in the Mexican population and named Veracruz (Arg365His), G6PD
Seattle (Asp282His), and G6PD Mexico DF (Thr65Ala), whose biochemical characterization have not yet been studied. For
this reason, in this work we analyzed the putative role of the three mutations to uncover the functional consequences on
G6PD activity. To this end, was developed a method to clone, overexpress, and purify recombinant human G6PD. The results
obtained from all variants showed a loss of catalysis by 80 to 97% and had a decrease in affinity for both physiological
substrates with respect to the wild type (WT) G6PD. Our results also showed that the three mutations affected
three-dimensional structure and protein stability, suggesting an unstable structure with low conformational stability
that affected its G6PD functionality. Finally, based on the biochemical characterization of the unclassified G6PD Mexico
DF, we suggest that this variant could be grouped as a Class I variant, because biochemical data are similar with other
Class I G6PDs.</p> </div> </details> </div> </article><article id="paper-2018-02" class="publication-card" style="--publication-body-img-width: 68%"> <div class="publication-media"> <img src="/_astro/thumbnail.aK6mdMoJ.png" alt="First page thumbnail of publication" loading="lazy"> </div> <div class="publication-body"> <h3> <a href="#paper-2018-02">Biochemical Characterization and Structural Modeling of Fused Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase-Phosphogluconolactonase from Giardia lamblia</a> </h3> <p class="publication-authors">Laura Morales-Luna, Hugo Serrano-Posada, Abigail González-Valdez, Daniel Ortega-Cuellar, America Vanoye-Carlo, Beatriz Hernández-Ochoa, Edgar Sierra-Palacios, Yadira Rufino-González, Rosa A.

6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) gene (6pgl). Therefore, in this work, we decided to characterize the fused G6PD-6PGL
protein in Giardia lamblia. First, the gene of g6pd fused with the 6pgl gene (6gpd::6pgl) was isolated from trophozoites
of Giardia lamblia and the corresponding G6PD::6PGL protein was overexpressed and purified in Escherichia coli. Then, we
characterized the native oligomeric state of the G6PD::6PGL protein in solution and we found a catalytic dimer with an
optimum pH of 8.75. Furthermore, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for the G6PD domain and measured the
thermal stability of the protein in both the presence and absence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and observed that
the G6PD::6PGL protein showed alterations in the stability, secondary structure, and tertiary structure in the presence
of Gdn-HCl. Finally, computer modeling studies revealed unique structural and functional features, which clearly
established the differences between G6PD::6PGL protein from G. lamblia and the human G6PD enzyme, proving that the model
can be used for the design of new drugs with antigiardiasic activity. These results broaden the perspective for future

It is estimated that the conventional
drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion

methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational
methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead
optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts.
It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have
had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review

to create novel anticancer drugs.</p>
